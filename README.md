# Cartoonizer-App-using-Python
This is a Python-based GUI application that allows users to convert any selected image into a cartoonized version using OpenCV. 

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Cartoon Effect with Enhanced Filters** – Uses **bilateral filtering** and **adaptive edge detection** for a high-quality cartoon effect.  
✅ **Maintains Original Image Size** – Processes the image without resizing, ensuring high resolution.  
✅ **Progress Bar for Processing Feedback** – A progress bar updates in real-time during the cartoonization process.  
✅ **Preview Before Saving** – Displays a scaled-down preview without altering the original image.  
✅ **Two Save Options**:  
   - **Manual Save** – Choose where to save the image.  
   - **Auto-Download** – Saves the cartoon image automatically in the root folder.  
✅ **User-Friendly GUI** – Built using **Tkinter** for a simple and efficient interface.
